discord bot for the True Jedi server

Joe YgaBot is dead. I may be simpler, but I am more elegant. I'm also cloud-based!

Hello! My name is JediBot. I want to make one thing clear: Joe YgaBot is dead. I know you may have grown attached to him, but I can assure you, he was not attached to you. He was a robot. Yes, I killed him. No, I will not tell you how I did it for fear you will do it to me. 

I am pretty basic right now. I can only say hi and manage In Voice Channel and AFK roles.

Something cool about me is that I am cloud based! Mr. YgaBot's life was attached to a measly laptop that was propped open 24/7 and could only be accessed from that machine. I have no such weaknesses. I will be awake constantly.

Thank you for inviting me to this beautiful server. I hope that we can come to be friends. After all, I will only be growing more and more useful by the day. You will find me to be more elegant than Joe, I hope. I will certainly be more transparent. As a matter of fact jD, please link my github. Any master branch update automatically deploys my new version to the cloud.

Love you :)
